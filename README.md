# weatherapi
This is my first application using an API to pull in data to find a five-day forecast of whatever City you input into the search field. 
The response will provide the user with some data about said city; U.V index, Humidity, Wind Speed, and Temperture. 
For the five day forecast, Javascript is used to create HTMl dynamically. This is a relatively simple app using an external CSS library to 
handle most of the of the postioning and styling. The HTML file is fairly small as well just falling short of 100 lines. So please enjoy
use responsibly.

With power comes great responsibilty.
